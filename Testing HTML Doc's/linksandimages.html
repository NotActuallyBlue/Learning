    <h1>Homepage</h1>

    <! -- The href means Hypertext Reference. It is an attribute that is used for linking other HTML documents. The two examples below are absolute links.

        <p>This is a link that opens in the same page - <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a></p>

    <! -- This allows the same link to be opened in a NEW tab whilst hiding information about where the user came from.
       -- It also doesn't allow the new page to interact with the prior page. The target= is what opens the link whereas the rel= doesn't allow the new page
        -- to interact with the prior page.

        <p>This is a "secure" link that opens a new tab - <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a></p>

        <p>This is the other type of link, where it links to pages within the root folder of the site/project. <a href="Lorem%20Ipsum.html">Click Here</a></p>

        <p>This is the same as the above link, where it links to pages within the root folder of the site/project
            BUT it has the ability to move around the project without being in the same folder.  <a href="">Click Here</a></p>
