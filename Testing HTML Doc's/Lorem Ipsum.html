  <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>

  <! -- I am just testing some simple stuff to get a better grasp of typing and using the basic html industry stuff. None of this will make any sense -->

    <p>You can create a paragraph by typing < p > and WebStorm will automatically close out the paragraph for you. <strong>Pretty neat feature!</strong></p>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply <strong>dummy</strong> text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>

    <p>This is going to be a <em>looooooong</em> journey! I still have no clue what I am doing to even get this. You can make up to 6 headings in single document? Maybe per body??</p>

    <p>We're going to list a few things here, such as some things I'd like to accomplish within the next couple of months. There is no particular order to any of this.</p>


  <h2>My First List</h2>
    <p>Things I'd like to accomplish within the next <strong>few months.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing a basic webpage for my portfolio.</li>
        <li>Learning the basics of Python.</li>
        <li>Creating a few basic webapps using Python and Javascript.</li>
    </ul>
