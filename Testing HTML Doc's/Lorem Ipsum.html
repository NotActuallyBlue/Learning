  <! -- I am just testing some simple stuff to get a better grasp of typing and using the basic html industry stuff. None of this will make any sense -->

    <p>You can create a paragraph by typing < p > and WebStorm will automatically close out the paragraph for you. <strong>Pretty neat feature!</strong></p>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply <strong>dummy</strong> text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>

    <p>This is going to be a <em>looooooong</em> journey! I still have no clue what I am doing to even get this. You can make up to 6 headings in single document? Maybe per body??</p>
